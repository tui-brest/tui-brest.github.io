Most commonly\n\t * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n\t * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n\t *\n\t * ---\n\t *\n\t * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n\t * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n\t * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n\t * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n\t * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n\t * name of the component).\n\t *\n\t * ---\n\t *\n\t * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n\t * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n\t * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n\t * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n\t *\n\t * ```jsx\n\t * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n\t *\n\t * const duration = 300;\n\t *\n\t * const defaultStyle = {\n\t *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n\t *   opacity: 0,\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * const transitionStyles = {\n\t *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n\t *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n\t * };\n\t *\n\t * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n\t *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n\t *     {state => (\n\t *       <div style={{\n\t *         ...defaultStyle,\n\t *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n\t *       }}>\n\t *         I'm a fade Transition!\n\t *       </div>\n\t *     )}\n\t *   </Transition>\n\t * );\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n\t *  - `'entering'`\n\t *  - `'entered'`\n\t *  - `'exiting'`\n\t *  - `'exited'`\n\t *\n\t * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n\t * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n\t * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n\t * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n\t * the following example (we'll use the\n\t * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n\t *\n\t * ```jsx\n\t * function App() {\n\t *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n\t *   return (\n\t *     <div>\n\t *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n\t *         {state => (\n\t *           // ...\n\t *         )}\n\t *       </Transition>\n\t *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n\t *         Click to Enter\n\t *       </button>\n\t *     </div>\n\t *   );\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n\t * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n\t * to `'entered'`.\n\t *\n\t * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n\t * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n\t */\n\t\n\texports.EXITING = EXITING;\n\t\n\tvar Transition =\n\t/*#__PURE__*/\n\tfunction (_React$Component) {\n\t  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\t\n\t  function Transition(props, context) {\n\t    var _this;\n\t\n\t    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n\t    var parentGroup = context.transitionGroup; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\t\n\t    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?

Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * ---\n *\n * **Note**: `Transition` is a platform-agnostic base component. If you're using\n * transitions in CSS, you'll probably want to use\n * [`CSSTransition`](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)\n * instead. It inherits all the features of `Transition`, but contains\n * additional features necessary to play nice with CSS transitions (hence the\n * name of the component).\n *\n * ---\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the\n * components. It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For\n * example we can add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import { Transition } from 'react-transition-group';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {state => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component\n * begins the \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from\n * its current transition state, to `'entering'` for the duration of the\n * transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once it's complete. Let's take\n * the following example (we'll use the\n * [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook):\n *\n * ```jsx\n * function App() {\n *   const [inProp, setInProp] = useState(false);\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={inProp} timeout={500}>\n *         {state => (\n *           // ...\n *         )}\n *       </Transition>\n *       <button onClick={() => setInProp(true)}>\n *         Click to Enter\n *       </button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state\n * and stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches\n * to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from\n * `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nexports.EXITING = EXITING;\n\nvar Transition =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    var _this;\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n    var parentGroup = context.transitionGroup; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?

Из наиболее важных используемых технологий стоит отметить площадку капельного полива,\n                а также промышленные теплицы с автоматическим поливом и, конечно, современную посадочную и выкопочную технику.\n                Мы предлагаем более 50 видов хвойных растений, выращенных в нашем питомнике. Все растения продаются с закрытой корневой системой. `,\n        text2: `Сложно даже представить, что это пушистое и уже привычное в парках и на участках \n            деревце не встречается в дикой природе наших краёв. Туя попала к нам из юго-восточной части Канады \n            и северной части США несколько столетий назад. В естественных условиях, на своей родине, туя вырастает \n            до 20 метров, в наших же широтах привычнее видеть её высотой около 10 метров. Туя это хвойное растение из \n            семейства Кипарисовых, которое может быть деревом или кустарником с плоскими побегами. Туя в любое время года \n            хорошо переносит посадку при правильных действиях садовода. Ежедневно вдыхая хвойный аромат туи, мы восстанавливаем \n            силы после болезни и стресса, легче преодолеваем физическую и эмоциональную усталость. Если вам нужно выбрать \n            растение для живой изгороди, уголка отдыха или украсить крыльцо, террасу — остановитесь на туе, особенно \n            когда на участке заболоченные и торфянистые почвы, малопригодные для большинства плодовых и ягодных культур. \n            Одиночные растения туи хорошо выглядят на фоне газона или других древесных пород. Из них можно сформировать затейливую \n            группу и живую изгородь, создать аллею или небольшую рощу. Все будет выглядеть живописно. В зависимости от сорта, \n            туя может быть представлена небольшим кустарником чуть больше полуметра, а может быть чуть ли не полноценным деревом, \n            вырастая до двух метров в высоту. Учитывая эти особенности, можно дополнять туями какие-то декоративные элементы на участке \n            или высаживать их особняком, чтобы они сами по себе служили объектами в ландшафтном дизайне`\n    }\n};\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/service/TranslationService.js","'use strict';\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\n\nvar _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; };\n\nvar _createClass = function () { function defineProperties(target, props) { for (var i = 0; i < props.length; i++) { var descriptor = props[i]; descriptor.enumerable = descriptor.enumerable || false; descriptor.configurable = true; if (\"value\" in descriptor) descriptor.writable = true; Object.defineProperty(target, descriptor.key, descriptor); } } return function (Constructor, protoProps, staticProps) { if (protoProps) defineProperties(Constructor.prototype, protoProps); if (staticProps) defineProperties(Constructor, staticProps); return Constructor; }; }();\n\nvar _createRule = require('./utils/createRule');\n\nvar _createRule2 = _interopRequireDefault(_createRule);\n\nvar _linkRule = require('./utils/linkRule');\n\nvar _linkRule2 = _interopRequireDefault(_linkRule);\n\nvar _StyleRule = require('./rules/StyleRule');\n\nvar _StyleRule2 = _interopRequireDefault(_StyleRule);\n\nvar _escape = require('./utils/escape');\n\nvar _escape2 = _interopRequireDefault(_escape);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?
